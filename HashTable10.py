'''Set: Longest Consecutive Sequence (âš¡Interview Question)
Given an unsorted array of integers, write a function that finds the length of the  longest_consecutive_sequence (i.e., sequence of integers in which each element is one greater than the previous element).

Use sets to optimize the runtime of your solution.

Input: An unsorted array of integers, nums.

Output: An integer representing the length of the longest consecutive sequence in nums.

Example:



Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence in the input array is [4, 3, 2, 1], and its length is 4.'''


def longest_sequenxe(nums):
    set_num = set(nums)
    longest_seq = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if num-1 not in set_num:
            current = num
            curr_seq = 1
            
            while current + 1 in set_num:
                current += 1
                curr_seq += 1
            
            longest_seq = max(longest_seq, curr_seq)
            
    return longest_seq


print( longest_sequenxe([100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]) )
