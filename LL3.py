LL: Remove Duplicates (âš¡Interview Question)
You are given a singly linked list that contains integer values, where some of these values may be duplicated.

Your task is to implement a method called remove_duplicates() within the LinkedList class that removes all duplicate values from the list.

Your method should not create a new list, but rather modify the existing list in-place, preserving the relative order of the nodes.

You can implement the remove_duplicates() method in two different ways:



Using a Set - This approach will have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. You are allowed to use the provided Set data structure in your implementation.

Without using a Set - This approach will have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. You are not allowed to use any additional data structures for this implementation.'''


class Node:
    def __init__(self,value):
        self.value =value
        self.next= None
        

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
        self.length = 1
        
    def remove_duplicates(self):
        values = set()
        prev = None
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.value in values:
                prev.next = current.next
                self.length -= 1
            else:
                values.add(current.value)
                prev = current
            current = current.next
