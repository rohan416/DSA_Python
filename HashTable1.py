'''Instructions:
HT: Item In Common (âš¡Interview Question)
Write a function item_in_common(list1, list2) that takes two lists as input and returns True if there is at least one common item between the two lists, False otherwise.

Use a dictionary to solve the problem that creates an O(n) time complexity.
